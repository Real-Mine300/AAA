      <h2>What is Anemia?</h2>
      <p>
        Anemia is a condition in which you lack enough healthy red blood cells to carry adequate
        oxygen to your body's tissues. Having anemia can make you feel tired and weak, as your
        body isn't getting enough oxygen to function properly.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many forms of anemia, each with its own cause. Anemia can be temporary or
        long term, and it can range from mild to severe. The most common cause of anemia worldwide
        is iron deficiency.

    <!-- Causes Section -->
    <section>
      <h2>Causes</h2>
      <p>
        Anemia occurs when your body doesn't have enough red blood cells or hemoglobin.
        This can happen for several reasons:
      </p>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Common Causes</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Iron deficiency:</strong> Most common cause, often due to blood loss or poor diet</li>
          <li><strong>Vitamin deficiencies:</strong> Lack of vitamin B12, folate, or vitamin C</li>
          <li><strong>Chronic diseases:</strong> Conditions like kidney disease, cancer, or inflammatory diseases</li>
          <li><strong>Blood loss:</strong> Heavy menstrual periods, ulcers, or surgery</li>
          <li><strong>Genetic conditions:</strong> Sickle cell anemia, thalassemia, or other inherited conditions</li>
          <li><strong>Bone marrow problems:</strong> Issues with red blood cell production</li>
          <li><strong>Rapid destruction of red blood cells:</strong> Hemolytic anemias</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Prevention</h2>
      <p>
        Many types of anemia can be prevented through a healthy diet and lifestyle choices.
        Here are some key prevention strategies:
      </p>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Prevention Strategies</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Eat iron-rich foods:</strong> Include lean meats, beans, spinach, and fortified cereals in your diet</li>
          <li><strong>Consume vitamin C:</strong> Helps your body absorb iron better (citrus fruits, tomatoes, bell peppers)</li>
          <li><strong>Include folate and B12:</strong> Important for red blood cell production (leafy greens, eggs, dairy)</li>
          <li><strong>Avoid iron blockers:</strong> Limit tea and coffee with meals, as they can reduce iron absorption</li>
          <li><strong>Manage blood loss:</strong> Seek treatment for heavy periods or other sources of blood loss</li>
          <li><strong>Regular check-ups:</strong> Get routine blood tests to monitor your iron levels</li>

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">What is the difference between iron-deficiency anemia and other types of anemia?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          Iron-deficiency anemia is caused by a lack of iron in the body, which is needed to make hemoglobin.
          Other types of anemia can be caused by vitamin deficiencies, genetic conditions, chronic diseases,
          or problems with red blood cell production or destruction. Each type requires different treatment approaches.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">Can anemia be cured?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          Many types of anemia can be effectively treated and even cured, especially those caused by
          nutritional deficiencies. Treatment depends on the underlying cause and may include dietary
          changes, supplements, or medical interventions. Some genetic types of anemia are managed
          rather than cured, but symptoms can often be controlled effectively.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">How is anemia diagnosed?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          Anemia is typically diagnosed through blood tests, including a complete blood count (CBC)
          that measures red blood cells, hemoglobin, and hematocrit levels. Additional tests may
          be needed to determine the specific cause of anemia.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">Should I take iron supplements?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          Iron supplements should only be taken under the guidance of a healthcare provider.
          Too much iron can be harmful, and supplements should be used when there's a confirmed
          deficiency or when recommended by a doctor. Always consult with a healthcare provider
          before starting any supplements.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">Can I get enough iron from a vegetarian or vegan diet?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          Yes, it's possible to get enough iron from plant-based sources, though it requires
          careful planning. Plant-based (non-heme) iron is not as easily absorbed as animal-based
          (heme) iron, so vegetarians and vegans should include plenty of iron-rich plant foods
          and pair them with vitamin C sources to enhance absorption.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">How long does it take to recover from anemia?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          Recovery time depends on the type and severity of anemia, as well as the treatment approach.
          With proper treatment, many people start feeling better within a few weeks, but it may take
          several months for iron stores to fully replenish. It's important to follow treatment
          recommendations and continue follow-up care as advised by your healthcare provider.
