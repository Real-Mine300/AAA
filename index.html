      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        Anemia Awareness Alliance (AAA) is dedicated to raising awareness about anemia,
        improving education, and supporting research aimed at prevention, early detection,
        and effective treatment. We work to empower individuals and communities with knowledge
        and resources to better understand and manage anemia.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anemia occurs when the body does not have enough healthy red blood cells to transport
        oxygen efficiently. It can affect anyone, but with proper awareness, prevention, and
        treatment, many cases can be managed effectively.

        <h3>What is Anemia?</h3>
        <p>
          Anemia is a condition in which you lack enough healthy red blood cells to carry adequate
          oxygen to your body's tissues. Having anemia can make you feel tired and weak. There are
          many forms of anemia, each with its own cause. Anemia can be temporary or long term, and
          it can range from mild to severe.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most common cause of anemia worldwide is iron deficiency. Iron is necessary for the
          production of hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout
          the body. When the body doesn't have enough iron, it can't produce enough healthy red
          blood cells.
